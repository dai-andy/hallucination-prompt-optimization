"'In stream processing, a watermark is an Apache Spark feature that can define a time-based threshold for processing data when performing stateful operations such as aggregations. Data arriving is processed until the threshold is reached, at which point the time window defined by the threshold is closed. Watermarks can be used to avoid problems during query processing, mainly when processing larger datasets or long-running processing. These problems can include high latency in producing results and even out-of-memory (OOM) errors because of the amount of data kept in state during processing. Because streaming data is inherently unordered, watermarks also support correctly calculating operations like time-window aggregations.'",What is the purpose of a watermark in Apache Spark's stream processing?,"To define a time-based threshold for processing data in stateful operations, avoiding high latency and out-of-memory errors, and supporting correct calculations in unordered streaming data.",factual,factual,"EXPLANATION: The answer mentions defining a time-based threshold for processing data in stateful operations, which aligns with the reference text stating that watermarks ""can define a time-based threshold for processing data when performing stateful operations such as aggregations.""
