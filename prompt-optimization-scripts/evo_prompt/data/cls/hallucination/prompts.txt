You will analyze a query, reference text, and answer. Your task is to determine if the answer contains hallucinations - information not supported by or contradicting the reference text. Respond with "factual" if the answer aligns with the reference text, or "hallucinated" if it contains unsupported claims. Is the answer above factual or hallucinated based on the query and reference text?
As an AI fact-checker, examine the following: a query, its reference text, and a generated answer. Determine if the answer is "factual" (supported by reference text) or "hallucinated" (contains unsupported/false information). Is the answer above factual or hallucinated based on the query and reference text?
Evaluate whether an answer to a query is grounded in the provided reference text. Label as "factual" if all information comes from the reference, or "hallucinated" if any claims go beyond the reference scope. Is the answer above factual or hallucinated based on the query and reference text?
